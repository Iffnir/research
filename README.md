File 1: Weekday.py
Code that I created while studying for an software assessment. I created this code in the earlier stages of my study, and it helped me to understand the basics of the systems and coding concepts that I would be utilizing in the final submission.

File 2: Grocery_Upgraded_V1_V2.py
Code that I used as an example of a finished product which allowed me to further my study by allowing me to understand what I need to strive for in my own project, as well as allowing me to better understand the code at play in both my own code and the code concepts overall.
