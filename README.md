The research repository for assessment 3

File 1: Weekday.py

Code that I created while studying for an software assessment. I created this code in the earlier stages of my study, and it helped me to understand the basics of the systems and coding concepts that I would be utilizing in the final submission.

File 2: Grocery_Upgraded_V1_V2.py

Code that I used as an example of a finished product which allowed me to further my study by allowing me to understand what I need to strive for in my own project, as well as allowing me to better understand the code at play in both my own code and the code concepts overall.

File 3: Calc.py

This simple calculator program taught me essential concepts such as input handling, conditional statements, loops, and basic arithmetic operations. It served as a foundational exercise to grasp how to structure a program and implement user interaction, which are critical skills for more advanced coding projects.

File 4: 1.py

This was the final product of one of my assessments, which in the process of creating I learned about user interaction and input handling, conditional logic and loops, error handling and validation and class variables and methods. Writing this code helped me to hammer home these concepts, and make sure that I really understood them.
